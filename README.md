This capstone its an upgrade to Next.js and Material-UI from my old capstone which was in React.js, Redux, Bootstrap, both are deployed.

Next.js - https://onestopshop-next.vercel.app it has more features than the old one.

React.js - https://onestopshop-test.vercel.app will update it with all the features once i finish all the features i have in mind in the Next.js version.

Old capstone client - https://github.com/JokeryEU/capstone_client

Old capstone server - https://github.com/JokeryEU/capstone_server - its being hosted on heroku free plan so it may take 5-10 sec for the data to show up in the client
